## Motivation & Reflection

I wanted to explore a project with:
  - a simple application of [hexagonal grids](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/),
  - SVGs generated dynamically via React, and
  - a simple, responsive, full-screen layout that works across common devices

A map generator for Settlers of Catan seemed like a good choice.

The project was reasonably straight-forward, with one exception. When adding the responsive layout, I initially had a lot of trouble maximising the svg within its parent. I first tried a combination of css grid & `height: 100%` on all parents, but no matter what I tried, the SVG wouldn't expand vertically. I thought I had tried everything, so I moved on to other approaches. I tried using `100vh`, but encountered the [iOS safari 100vh "quirk"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37112218/css3-100vh-not-constant-in-mobile-browser), so tried to use js (React's `useLayoutEffect`) to set a css variable containing `window.innerHeight`. But this completely broke the layout when zooming.

Overall, even if it were to work, it felt quite hacky. Surely a full-screen layout with a maximised SVG should be possible with only css. So I looked for web apps that had full-screen layouts on mobile devices with the intent to reverse engineer one and discover its layout secrets.

The plan was to find a minimal working version, and attempt to replicate it one step at a time until the problem was discovered. I found a working version and used the inspector to remove all non-layout related properties. Then I replaced the react app with the basic html structure of the working layout. I added css properties to the respective elements, one by one, expecting that eventually I would find the key. But when I added the last property, my layout still wouldn't expand vertically. I disabled the property on the working version, and found that it indeed removed the vertical scaling. So why didn't it work for my version? I compared the DOM trees side-by-side, and that's when I finally found it. Initially, because I used create-react-app, I had assumed that the div returned from the top-level [`App` component](src/components/App.js) was also the direct child of `<body>`. But I had overlooked that react renders in a [root element](src/index.js). Essentially, I had missed applying `height: 100%` to one element which prevented the same from working in all of its descendants. I had wasted hours and hours running down rabbit holes when all I needed to do was add the css rule `#root {height: 100%}`ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è As embarassing as it is to publish, perhaps it may give encouragement to another developer. At least it was a learning experience üòÖ
